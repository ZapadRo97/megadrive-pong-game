# Megadrive Pong Games
This is a very simple pong game made by following these [SGDK tutorials](http://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megapong/megapong-1/).
Since the tutorial series was not finalized there are few extras made by me (like limited lvies). This project is meant to be used as a starting point for everyone wishing to learn Megadrive game development using SGDK.
